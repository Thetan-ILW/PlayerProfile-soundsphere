# how2install

1. Download the code using green (or blue) button  that says `Code` on the top of this page.
2. Open your soundsphere directory on your drive.
3. Create `moddedgame` directory if it does not exist
4. Unpack this mod there. Here is how the path should look: `soundsphere/moddedgame/PlayerProfile-soundsphere/mod.lua`

# what is this
This thing adds something like a local profile to soundsphere. Specifically: 
1. osu performance points and average accuracy
2. osu levels
3. osu rank (pretty damn accurate)
4. Dan clears (4k, 7k, 10k)
5. MSD
6. Live MSD (scores lose their value over time)
